# 👋 Hello, World! Welcome to My GitHub!

I’m **Reza Jelvehgar**, a passionate Data Scientist,🌟  
In September 2017, I entered the Software Engineering Department at Persian Gulf University in Bushehr, where I began studying algorithms, flowcharts, and programming in C and C++. 
In March 2018, I started learning C# and successfully completed a real estate consultant project using this language.
By 2019, I had begun learning Python and participated in various programming competitions. During this time, I also worked on a skin cancer diagnosis project that utilized artificial intelligence, engaged in research and development, and collected data. Additionally, I completed a class scheduling project using genetic algorithms.
For my bachelor's thesis, I focused on optimal vehicle routing algorithms with artificial intelligence.
As of 2024, after completing my military service, I am working full-time as a data analyst. I have become proficient in Excel, statistics, probability, SQL, and various other analytical tools.
💻 Always learning and experimenting with new technologies.
